pyproj
======

Python project skeleton with pyenv.

Setup
=====

After cloning, you'll want to change to some other git repo for the new project:
	So you could rm -rf ./.git

or you could change the origin URL if you don't mind having this skeleton project's version history:
	git remote set-url origin https://github.com/user/projname.git

To setup a compatible python environment locally, run "source setup_env.sh".

After the environment has been set up once, when running use "source pyenv_paths.sh".
